# video_sorter

This Ruby script auto-sorts Movies & TV Shows from an `ORIGIN` folder to `TV_DESTINATION` and `MOVIE_DESTINATION` folders.

TV Shows are further sorted into folders by Title and then Season.

Usage:
```sh
$ ruby video_sorter.rb
```

*NOTE: After video files are copied into sorted folders, their original source file or folder is marked with the Red label in OSX.*
